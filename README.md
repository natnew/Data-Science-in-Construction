## Harnessing The Power of Data
The AEC (architecture, engineering, and construction) Industry has seen a dramatic shift in recent years. Companies are steadily realising the endless possibilities that come with harnessing Construction data. The current global pandemic (COVID) has also caused many businesses to use more digital tools that allow their workers to operate remotely. This shift is becoming more digital has led to a desire for companies to create, manage and maintain their digital data more effectively. Although relatively new to the construction industry, data science will help the sector gain better value from its data. This project aims to understand how data science can more effectively capture and manage construction data.

There are currently two main methods of collecting construction data. And that is through the use of IFC (industry foundation classes) and COBie (Construction Operations Building Information Exchange) files. However, with the development of digital twins and the connection of IoT devices to databases, the collection, and management of construction data will expand to other areas.


According to a recent report conducted by [Autodesk](https://a.storyblok.com/f/64835/x/137c281eda/harnessing_the_data_advantage_in_construction.pdf), there is an increase in AEC companies collecting data from construction technology than previously recorded.

**"82 of professionals are collecting more data from <br>construction technology today than three years ago."**

Many AEC companies see this data as unusable for several reasons and, as such, are unable to incorporate this data into decision-making. Most construction data collected over the years has often got lost in translation or just stored away. If the construction industry is to keep up with the growing defamed digital innovation expected in the future, it needs to find a way of harnessing that data.
